# Control tutorials

This project aims to teach control theory with a more intuitive approach than is often seen in universities. It consists of short lessons in many topics of control, including classical control, modern control, digital filtering, and digital control. It has been written using Jupyter Notebooks, meaning text, Python code, and plots can be displayed right here in Github. Alternatively, students may download the notebooks and tinker with the code if they desire.

These tutorials have been written with numerous worked and coded examples to demonstrate how the mathematics actually works. I've noticed many resources lack good, understandable explanations for this wildly abstract area of STEM, and want to show the beauty of control and how simple it can be once certain concepts are mastered.

## Why does this project exist?

I recently finished my PhD, where I spent thousands of hours teaching many control courses over five years. I loved my time teaching and saw firsthand where students struggled and found the best methods to help them learn at their own pace. Since leaving academia, I've wanted to preserve my knowledge in a way that could help people, and came up with the idea of writing a short course that anyone can access.
