    "# A closer look at poles\n",
    "\n",
    "With a basic idea of how poles may impact a system (i.e. poles with imaginary components causing oscillation, poles with negative real parts giving stability, etc), let's look into *why* that is. We'll do this by exploring the parallels between a transfer function (in the frequency domain) and its associated differential equation (in the time domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by considering the generalised mass-spring-damper equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m\\ddot{x}\\left(t\\right) + b\\dot{x}\\left(t\\right) + kx\\left(t\\right) = F\\left(t\\right) \\text{,} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\ddot{x}\\left(t\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 x}{\\partial t^2}$ and $\\dot{x}\\left(t\\right) = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll imagine we just \"let go of the system\" and let it do its own thing without applying any external forces; that is, let $F\\left(t\\right) = 0$. Thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m\\ddot{x}\\left(t\\right) + b\\dot{x}\\left(t\\right) + kx\\left(t\\right) = 0 \\text{.} $$\n",

    "Let's use our old friend the Laplace transform to find the values of the poles. By performing the transform, we get\n",

    "$$ m\\left[s^2X\\left(s\\right) - sx\\left(0\\right) - \\dot{x}\\left(0\\right)\\right] + b\\left[sX\\left(s\\right) - x\\left(0\\right)\\right] + k\\left[X\\left(s\\right)\\right] = 0 \\text{.} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the difference between $X\\left(s\\right)$ (frequency domain) and $x\\left(t\\right)$ (time domain). In this equation, we have several constant values. Let's group them up and rename them for simplicity.\n",
