    "Last time, we explored a basic proportional controller in the time domain. While this was somewhat intuitive, the time domain can be quite restrictive in many cases. As such, we often use the frequency domain for simple controller analysis. To convert from the time domain (using $t$) to the frequency domain (using $s$), we use the Laplace transform."
